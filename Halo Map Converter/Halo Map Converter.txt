Help=[[This tool is used to convert Halo Custom Edition maps to Halo Trial Edition maps and vice-versa. Mainly this converter is used to convert Halo Custom Edition maps to work with Halo Map Tools so the maps can be modded. This serves as a replacement for Halo Map Version Converter, as it was often buggy and didn't even work for me.]]
